# Code Directory

Here is a repository of code I intend on keeping code I worked on from the past/will work on future

Independent Work: Code that I worked on for my own projects (Junior Paper, Senior Thesis)

RA Work: Code I wrote for others

RCT Toolkit: For PhD Level Field Experiment/Development Class(FALL 2021). Many of the tools for RCT literature as of recently are implemented in R but not STATA. I aim to write code translating the R libaries into STATA.

Webscraping: Just for Fun. Public Goods?
